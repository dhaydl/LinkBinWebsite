# Version 1

## **Version 1.1.1**

- You now have the ability to open a link in the device's default browser via the context menu.
- Shortcuts actions and widgets can now be configured to query archived links and all links. The latter was added so that you don't have to recreate a widget or an action when you want to deselect a chosen label.
- The list with all labels that appears when you configure a Shortcuts action or a widget now comes with icons for a better visual appearance.
- LinkBin now supports Siri Suggestions.

## **Version 1.1.0**
Okay, this is a big one. Thank you for your patience until this update, I really appreciate it.

- Handoff support is here. Visit a link with the built-in browser and continue on another device where you left off.
- The macOS version also has an in-app browser now. This can be optionally deactivated from the app's settings.
