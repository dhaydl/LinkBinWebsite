# Version 1

## **Version 1.0.3**
- Newly created labels that are attached to a link afterwards did not get synced to iCloud in some cases. This is now fixed.
- The iCloud account status is now determined at every startup to avoid unwanted behaviour.
- Textfields are now immediately focused when they appear.
- On macOS, you were not able to create a new label when you wanted to assign it to a link. This is now possible.
- On iOS and iPadOS, there is now a new button that allows to save a link from the clipboard. This is similar to the CMD+V feature that was introduced in the last version.
- Editing and deleting labels on macOS was not possible due to a bug introduced in the last version. This is now elliminated.

## **Version 1.0.2**
This new version also comes with some bug fixes, as well as some improvements and two new features.

- The share extension on iOS now displays a little feedback that indicates if the shared link is saved successfully.
- You can now rename labels and change their color.
- On macOS, the button for the privacy policy pointed to a wrong URL. This is now fixed.
- Save links from the clipboard by pressing CMD + V on an iPad or a Mac. When you have a label open, it will get attached automatically.
- It is now possible to create a new label from the view where you can assign one to a link.
- Adjusted the appearance of the buttons for creating a label.

## **Version 1.0.1**
Thank you for using LinkBin and giving feedback. I really appreciate your support. This version contains bug fixes and some minor improvements and additions.

- LinkBin's share extension now supports text. This means that you can share a text from a text editing app and LinkBin parses all links in it.
- Added a share sheet on iOS and a share menu on macOS.
- If you select black or a dark color for a label's color, the font color automatically turns to white.
- Added a link to LinkBin's Twitter account in settings.
- Corrected a typo in the App Store description.
- Adjusted the size of the screenshots on the App Store page so that their content is more readable.

## **Version 1.0.0**
Initial version of LinkBin.
