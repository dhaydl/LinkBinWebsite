# **Version 1.0.1**
Thank you for using LinkBin and giving feedback. I really appreciate your support. This version contains bug fixes and some minor improvements and additions.

- LinkBin's share extension now supports text. This means that you can share a text from a text editing app and LinkBin parses all links in it.
- Added a share sheet on iOS and a share menu on macOS.
- If you select black or a dark color for a label's color, the font color automatically turns to white.
- Added a link to LinkBin's Twitter account in settings.
- Corrected a typo in the App Store description.
- Adjusted the size of the screenshots on the App Store page so that their content is more readable.

# **Version 1.0.0**
Initial version of LinkBin.
