## How we store data

Everything you save in LinkBin is written to your device's local storage. Data is synced via your private iCloud container between devices the devices you are signed in to your account, so nobody except you can access it.

## Purchases

When you purchase a LinkBin Club package, RevenueCat handles the transaction in the background and generates a purchase history. Therefore, an anonymous user token is generated that can not be linked to your identity.

## Typeform

In order to make it possible for users to report bugs, we use the service Typeform. You can find their privacy policy [here](https://admin.typeform.com/to/dwk6gt).
